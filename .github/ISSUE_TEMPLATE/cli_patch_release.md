This issue can be closed when we have completed the following steps (in order).
Please ensure all artifacts (PRs, workflow runs, Tweets, etc) are linked from
this issue for posterity.

- [ ] Confirm that Crossplane dependencies are up-to-date in the release
      branch. These dependencies should be updated routinely by Renovate, but
      may need a manual update if a CLI release is closely following a core
      release.
- [ ] Confirm that all security/critical dependency update PRs from Renovate
      are merged into `main`
  - https://github.com/crossplane/cli/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+label%3Aautomated
- [ ] Run the [Tag workflow][tag-workflow] on the `release-X.Y` branch with the
      proper release version, `vX.Y.Z`. Message suggested, but not required:
      `Release vX.Y.Z`.
- [ ] Run the [CI workflow][ci-workflow] on the release branch and verified that
      the tagged build version exists on the [cli.crossplane.io] `build`
      channel, e.g. `build/release-X.Y/vX.Y.Z/...` should contain all the
      relevant binaries.
- [ ] (On the **Release** Branch) Run the [Promote workflow][promote-workflow]
      with version `vX.Y.Z` and channel `stable`, ticking the box for `This is a
      pre-release` if this patch is not for the most recent minor version. Then,
      verify:
  - [ ] The tagged build version exists on the [cli.crossplane.io] `stable`
        channel at `stable/vX.Y.Z/...`.
  - [ ] The `current` release in the `stable` channel is `vX.Y.Z` if `vX.Y` is
        the most recent minor version. If not, the `current` release should
        still be the most recent patch of the most recent minor version.
- [ ] Publish a [new release] for the tagged version as `pre-release`, with
      the same name as the version, taking care of generating the changes list
      selecting as "Previous tag" `vX.Y.<Z-1>`, so the first of the releases
      for the previous minor.
  - [ ] Select the `Set as the latest release` checkbox if this is a patch for
        the most recent minor version.
  - [ ] Use this
        [example](https://github.com/crossplane/cli/releases/tag/v2.3.2) for the
        body of the release.
- [ ] Request @jbw976 or @adamwg to perform a CloudFront cache invalidation on
      https://cli.crossplane.io/stable/.
- [ ] Update CLI reference documentation for the release.
  - [ ] Check out the [crossplane/docs] repository.
  - [ ] Download the new release binary by running `curl
        https://cli.crossplane.io/install.sh | XP_VERSION=vX.Y.Z sh` and ensure
        you get the new version. Download directly from [cli.crossplane.io] if
        needed.
  - [ ] In the docs repo, update the command reference using the new release:
        `./crossplane generate-docs -o content/cli/vX.Y/command-reference.md`.
  - [ ] Create and merge a PR with the updated content.
- [ ] Notify users about the release on the `#announcements` channel of the
      Crossplane Slack workspace.
