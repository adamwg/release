### Code Freeze

- [ ] Determine if any patch releases are needed in addition to this main
      release and open a [new patch release issue][new-patch-release-issue] for
      each.
- [ ] Confirm that Crossplane dependencies are up-to-date in `main`. These
      dependencies should be updated routinely by Renovate, but may need a
      manual update if a CLI release is closely following a core release.
- [ ] Confirm that all security/critical dependency update PRs from Renovate
      are merged into `main`
  - https://github.com/crossplane/cli/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+label%3Aautomated
- [ ] Create the release branch using the [GitHub UI][create-branch].
- [ ] (On the **Main** Branch) create and merge a PR to add the new release
      branch to the `baseBranches` list in `.github/renovate-base.json5`.
  - This **must** be done before creating tags below because of assumptions
    our CI/build process makes about tags and branches.
- [ ] (On the **Main** Branch) Run the [Tag workflow][tag-workflow] with the
      release candidate tag for the next release, `vX.Y+1.0-rc.0`. Message
      suggested, but not required: `Release candidate vX.Y+1.0-rc.0`.
- [ ] (On the **Release** Branch) Run the [Tag workflow][tag-workflow] with
      the release candidate tag for the release `vX.Y.0-rc.1` (assuming the
      latest rc tag for `vX.Y.0` is `vX.Y.0-rc.0`). Message suggested but not
      required: `Release candidate vX.Y.0-rc.1`.
- [ ] (On the **Release** Branch) Run the [CI workflow][ci-workflow] and
      verified that the tagged build version exists on the [cli.crossplane.io]
      `build` channel, e.g. `build/release-X.Y/vX.Y.0-rc.1/...` should contain
      all the relevant binaries.
- [ ] (On the **Release** Branch) Run the [Promote workflow][promote-workflow]
      with version `vX.Y.0-rc.1` and channel `stable`, ticking the box for
      `This is a pre-release` and verify:
  - [ ] The tagged build version exists on the [cli.crossplane.io] `stable`
        channel at `stable/vX.Y.0-rc.1/...`.
  - [ ] The `current` release in the `stable` channel is still the previous
        non-RC release.
- [ ] Publish a [new release] for the tagged version as `pre-release`, with
      the same name as the version, taking care of generating the changes list
      selecting as "Previous tag" `vX.<Y-1>.0`, so the first of the releases
      for the previous minor.
  - [ ] Select the `Set as a pre-release` and `Create a discussion for this
        release` checkboxes.
  - [ ] Do NOT select the `Set as the latest release` checkbox.
  - [ ] Use this
        [example](https://github.com/crossplane/cli/releases/tag/v2.3.0) for
        the body of the release.
- [ ] Notify users about the release candidate on the `#announcements` channel
      of the Crossplane Slack workspace.

### Release

- [ ] (On the **Release** Branch) Confirm that all security/critical dependency
      update PRs from Renovate are merged into `release-X.Y`:
  - https://github.com/crossplane/cli/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+label%3Aautomated
- [ ] (On the **Release** Branch) Run the [Tag workflow][tag-workflow] with the
      proper release version, `vX.Y.0`. Message suggested, but not required:
      `Release vX.Y.0`.
- [ ] (On the **Release** Branch) Run the [CI workflow][ci-workflow] and
      verified that the tagged build version exists on the [cli.crossplane.io]
      `build` channel, e.g. `build/release-X.Y/vX.Y.0/...` should contain all
      the relevant binaries.
- [ ] (On the **Release** Branch) Run the [Promote workflow][promote-workflow]
      with channel `stable` and verified that the tagged build version exists on
      the [cli.crossplane.io] `stable` channel at `stable/vX.Y.0/...`.
- [ ] Select a release MVP from the community that had significant impact on the
      release and include recognition of them in the release notes and blog
      post.
- [ ] Publish a [new release] for the tagged version, with the same name as the
      version and descriptive release notes
  - [ ] Generate the changes list by selecting the "Previous tag" as
        `vX.<Y-1>.0`, i.e., the first of the releases for the previous minor.
  - [ ] Ensure the release MVP is recognized in the release notes.
  - [ ] Before publishing the release notes, set them as Draft and ask the rest
        of the team to double check them.
- [ ] Request @jbw976 or @adamwg to perform a CloudFront cache invalidation on
      https://cli.crossplane.io/stable/.
- [ ] Update CLI reference documentation for the release.
  - [ ] Check out the [crossplane/docs] repository.
  - [ ] In the docs repo, copy the `master` documentation for the new release:
        `cp -R content/cli/master content/cli/vX.Y`.
  - [ ] Download the new release binary by running `curl
        https://cli.crossplane.io/install.sh | sh` and ensure you get the new
        version. Download directly from [cli.crossplane.io] if needed.
  - [ ] In the docs repo, update the command reference using the new release:
        `./crossplane generate-docs -o content/cli/vX.Y/command-reference.md`.
  - [ ] Create and merge a PR with the updated content.
- [ ] Publish a blog post about the release to the [crossplane blog]
  - [ ] Ensure the release MVP is recognized in the blog post
- [ ] Notify users about the release on the `#announcements` channel of the
      Crossplane Slack workspace.
